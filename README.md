# JavaScript
A number game I made with Javascript. I did it using two different loops (For and While).
I give the user 5 rights. If the number entered by the user is close to the given number, I tell him to increase-
the number, if it is far, I send him to decrease the number. If he gives the correct answer, the process ends, if he cannot, it continues until5 rights are filled and the answer is shown at the end.
